üõ©Ô∏è Drone Solutions Development with DJI Mobile SDK

Throughout my career, I have designed and developed the MapViewer4Android application, which integrates 2D mapping, DJI drone missions, and secure communication via Wi-Fi and DATA SIM. This application leverages the DJI Mobile SDK to provide full control over drones, including flight management, camera operation, mission planning, and real-time data retrieval.

Skills & Technologies Used:

Programming: Java and C++ (via Android NDK)

Drone Control: Full flight and camera control using DJI Mobile SDK

Communication: Integration of Wi-Fi and DATA SIM connectivity for drone communication

Mapping & Missions: Planning and executing missions using offline and online maps

Data Retrieval & Analysis: Real-time data acquisition and analysis from drones
